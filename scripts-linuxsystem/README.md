# scripts-linuxsystem
A series of scripts I created to use on any **GNU/Linux** system. New scripts that I find useful and want to share will be uploaded.

# Install

To install the scripts and use them, you'll need to first clone the repository with the following command:

    git clone https://github.com/TheWatcherMultiversal/scripts-linuxsystem.git

Then navigate to the directory and execute the script `./install.sh` within it.

    cd ./scripts-linuxsystem
    source ./install.sh

Once the installation script is executed, you'll be able to use the scripts included in this repository.

> You can **uninstall** these scripts using the `-u` option in the `./install.sh` script.
